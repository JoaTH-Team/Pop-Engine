# Pop Engine
Pop Engine is a scripted game engine

## Feature
- Lua/HScript scripting game (Lua still Buggy as hell :sob:)
- Able to create more callback if the current base one not enough (by using HScript only)
- Simple Manager State to load content game
- A simple crash handler (is will show pop-up and then create a log file from it)
