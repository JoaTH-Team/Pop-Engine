# HScript Type stuff
On Pop Engine `v2.0.0`, there have 2 type of HScript: `iris (default)`, `flixel (wip)`

## What these type
### Iris Type
Use haxelib `hscript-iris`, this is the default HScript type Pop Engine use
### Flixel Type
From haxelib `flixel-modding` and has been extends to have call function, this is actually can be used but we recommeneded use `iris` type first!, or if you want to try something cool :>>

## How to use them
### Iris Type
You don't need to do thing actually, because the `iris` type is already use by default
### Flixel Type
Open the terminal and type like:
- Command-line: `Pop Engine.exe` use hscript=flixel
- Powershell: ./"Pop Engine.exe" use hscript=flixel

Press enter and run, if the game said like `Pop Engine HScript use type: flixel`, mean you are successfully run Pop Engine with Flixel type
